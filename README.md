A Domino Racing Game.
Player 1 will roll the dice first.
If its not 1, player 1 will roll dice consequently & all the points will be added to the player 1.
If player 1 clicks on hold, the game will switch to player 2 without losing any points of player 1.
However, if any of the players rolls 1, all his previous points will be lost (starting from 0 again) & the game will switch to the opponent player.
Whoever scors 100 points first will win.
Of course, the game can be reset.
